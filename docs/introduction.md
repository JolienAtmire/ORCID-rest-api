# DSpace ORCID-rest-api

## Introduction

[ORCID](https://www.orcid.org) is a service that attaches a persistent digital identifier to a specific researcher by linking his/her name with a resolvable internet address, also called an ORCID ID. This ID allows for an easy distinction between different researches and makes it possible for one researcher to link all of his/her publications in an easy and straightforward manner.

DSpace as a software can be integrated with the ORCID database. When such an ORCID integration has been set up, the authority key field is leveraged to link the author to his ORCID ID. This patch extends the features that become available in DSpace once an integration with the ORCID database has been done. 

The DSpace ORCID REST API patch has been developed and is maintained by [Atmire](https://www.atmire.com), a registered service provider for DSpace. It has been funded and contributed to the DSpace community by the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en).
